# ðŸ”— Interdependency Analysis
## Critical Path Dependencies
1.  **Device Fingerprinting â†’ Usage Limits:** Device management must be complete before implementing usage tracking
2. **Question Models â†’ Filtering UI:** Data models needed before building filtering interface
3. **Question Models â†’ CSV Import:** Backend models required for import functionality
4. **Filtering UI â†’ Practice Sessions:** Need question selection before practice mode
5. **Practice Sessions â†’ Answer Submission:** Session management needed for answer tracking
6.**Answer Submission â†’ Offline Mode:** Core practice flow needed before offline features
7. **Filtering UI â†’ Sprint Exams:** Question selection needed for exam configuration
8. **Sprint Exams â†’ Simulated Exams:** Basic exam flow needed before full simulation
9. **Exam Interfaces â†’ Results Analytics:** Need exams before analyzing results
## Parallel Development Opportunities
* Question system can develop alongside device management
* Security rules can be implemented early and in parallel
* Redis caching can be added incrementally
* BigQuery setup can happen after basic practice/exam flows are working
## ðŸ“… Optimized Development Plan
**PHASE 2A: Device & Limits (Week 1-2)**  
**Focus:** Complete user management foundation

```
Device Fingerprinting (In Progress)
    â†“
Usage Limit Tracking
    â†“
Anonymous User Flow Polish
```

**Why this order?** Device fingerprinting is your business differentiator - must be rock-solid before adding limits.

**PHASE 2B: Question System (Week 1-3) - PARALLEL TRACK**  
**Focus:** Content management and discovery

```
Question Data Models (Flutter + Backend)
    â†“
â”œâ”€â”€ Question Filtering UI
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Practice Session Management
â””â”€â”€ CSV Import System (Admin)
    â””â”€â”€ Content Moderation

```


**Why parallel?** Question system is independent of device management and can be developed simultaneously.  

**PHASE 2C: Practice Mode (Week 2-4)**  
**Focus:** Core learning functionality
```
Practice Session Management
    â†“
Answer Submission with Timing
    â†“
Offline Mode Support

```


**Why this sequence?**Each step builds on the previous - need sessions before answers, answers before offline.  

**PHASE 2D: Exam System (Week 3-5)**  
**Focus:** Assessment capabilities
```
Sprint Exam Configuration
    â†“
Simulated Real Exam Interface
    â†“
Exam Results & Analytics

```


**Why this order?** Start with simpler sprint exams to validate the pattern, then build full simulations.

**PHASE 2E: Infrastructure (Ongoing)**  
**Focus:** Performance and security
```
Firebase Security Rules (Early priority)
    â†“
Redis Cache Layer (After basic flows)
    â†“
BigQuery Analytics (After practice/exams)

```


## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Starting Sequence
 **Week 1: Foundation Completion**  
1. **Complete Device Fingerprinting (currently in progress)**
2. **Start Question Data Models (parallel track)**
3. **Setup Firebase Security Rules (parallel infrastructure)**
### Week 2: Core Features
1. **Implement Usage Limits (depends on device fingerprinting)**
2. **Build Question Filtering UI (depends on models)**
3. **Begin Practice Sessions (depends on filtering)**
### Week 3: Advanced Features
1. **Add Answer Submission (depends on practice sessions)**
2. **Implement CSV Import (depends on models)**
3. **Start Sprint Exams (depends on filtering)**
### Week 4-5: Polish & Scale
1. ***Offline Mode (depends on answer submission)**
2. ***Simulated Exams (depends on sprint exams)**
3. **Results Analytics (depends on exam interfaces)**
## ðŸš€ Efficiency Optimizations
**Parallel Development Teams**  
* **Team A:** Device management & limits  
* **Team B:** Question system & filtering
* **Team C:** Practice mode & offline
* **Team D:** Exam system & analytics
* **Team E:** Infrastructure & security  
#### Early Infrastructure Wins
* Deploy security rules immediately (can be done in parallel)
* Setup Redis early for caching hot paths
* Begin BigQuery schema design now
#### Risk Mitigation
* **Device fingerprinting:** Test extensively across browsers/platforms
* **Question models:** Start with minimal viable schema, expand later
*  **Practice flow:** Implement basic version first, add timing/offline later
## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics by Phase
* **End of Week 2:** Device limits working, question filtering functional
* **End of Week 3:** Basic practice mode complete, sprint exams working
* **End of Week 4:** Offline mode functional, simulated exams ready
* **End of Week 5:** Full exam system with analytics
This plan maximizes parallel development while respecting critical dependencies, ensuring efficient progress toward your MVP. The device fingerprinting focus aligns with your business model, while the question system provides the core learning value.
